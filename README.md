# Mastercard Cybersecurity Analyst Training - Forage Program
As part of the Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience, I worked as an Analyst in the Security Awareness Team, focusing on building robust security awareness across organizations.

## Role Overview
The Chief Security Officer (CSO) relies on the Security Awareness Team to educate staff about identifying and reporting security threats, with a particular focus on phishing attacks, one of the most common and impactful threats organizations face today.

## Key Project: Phishing Awareness & Simulation Campaigns
### Phishing Definition:
Phishing involves impersonating a trusted entity to steal sensitive information, such as passwords, financial data, or system credentials.

### Attackers often send malicious links or attachments to:
Infect systems with malware.
Trick recipients into revealing sensitive data.
### Impact:
Successful phishing attempts can cost organizations millions of dollars and compromise both business integrity and employee safety.

### Mastercardâ€™s Mitigation Strategy:
To combat phishing threats, Mastercard uses phishing simulation campaigns to enhance employee awareness:

### Simulated Phishing Emails:
Fake phishing emails resembling real-world attack patterns are sent to staff monthly.
### Awareness Assessment:
Results from these simulations are analyzed to identify areas of improvement.
### Continuous Training:
Insights are used to design and implement future security training programs.

## Through this training:

- I learned about the critical importance of phishing awareness and its role in organizational security.
- I gained insights into designing effective phishing simulations to identify vulnerabilities.
- I understood how to analyze simulation results and tailor security education to mitigate threats.
